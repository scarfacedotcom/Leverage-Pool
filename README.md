## What is Frax?

Frax is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain â€“ currently implemented on Ethereum (with possible cross chain implementations in the future). The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.

## Constructor

`

    constructor(
            IERC20 _collateralToken,
            IOracle _oracle,
            IFundingRateModel _fundingRateModel,
            uint256 _inception
        ) {
            collateralToken = _collateralToken;
            oracle = _oracle;
            fundingRateModel = _fundingRateModel;
            price = int256(getPrice());
            admin = msg.sender;
            epochStartTime = _inception==0?block.timestamp:_inception;

    }

`

## The constructor takes in four parameters:

    - _collateralToken: The address of the ERC20 token used as collateral for the contract.
    - _oracle: The address of the Oracle contract used to obtain the current price of the underlying asset.
    - _fundingRateModel: The address of the funding rate model contract used to calculate the funding rates for the contracts.
    - _inception: The time (in Unix timestamp) at which the contract was deployed. If set to 0, the current block timestamp is used instead.

### Here's a breakdown of what happens in the constructor:

- The collateralToken, oracle, and fundingRateModel variables are assigned the values of the corresponding parameters.
- The price variable is set to the current price of the underlying asset, obtained from the Oracle contract using the getPrice() function.
- The admin variable is set to the address of the contract deployer (msg.sender).
- The epochStartTime variable is set to the \_inception parameter value if it is not equal to 0, or to the current block timestamp if \_inception is set to 0.

  ## ========== EXTERNAL STATE CHANGING ==========

             ##    Schedule a deposit for the next epoch

      ### 1. The deposit function

  `

          function deposit(int256 amount, uint256 pool) external  {
          require (pool<pools.length,"Pool not initialized");
          require (amount>=0,"amount needs to be positive");
          _bookKeeping(msg.sender);

          UserInfo storage info = userInfo[msg.sender];

          // Try to pay from the withdrawableCollateral first
          int256 transferAmount = amount;
          if (info.withdrawableCollateral>0) {
              if (transferAmount>info.withdrawableCollateral) {
                  transferAmount-=info.withdrawableCollateral;
                  info.withdrawableCollateral=0;
              } else {
                  info.withdrawableCollateral-=transferAmount;
                  transferAmount=0;
              }
          }
          if (transferAmount>0 && address(collateralToken)!=address(0x0)) require(collateralToken.transferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),uint256(transferAmount)),"Transfer failed");

          Action memory action;
          action.epoch = _getNextEpoch();
          action.pool = pool;
          action.depositAmount = amount;
          info.actions.push(action);

          PoolEpochData storage data = poolEpochData[action.epoch][action.pool];
          data.deposits+=amount;
          emit DepositInPool(msg.sender,amount,pool,action.epoch);
      }

`

    - The deposit function is an external state-changing function that schedules a deposit for the next epoch. It takes two parameters: amount of type int256 and pool of type uint256. The function first checks if the specified pool is initialized and if the amount is positive. Then it performs some bookkeeping, initializes a new Action struct and adds it to the user's actions array. The function also updates the deposits value in the poolEpochData mapping for the specified pool and epoch. Finally, the function emits a DepositInPool event with the msg.sender, amount, pool, and epoch as parameters.

    
    
    
    **  Schedule a withdraw for the next epoch

`

    function withdraw(int256 amount, uint256 pool) external  {
        require (pool<pools.length,"Pool not initialized");
        require (amount>=0,"amount needs to be positive");
        _bookKeeping(msg.sender);

        UserInfo storage  info =  userInfo[msg.sender];
        require(info.shares[pool]>=amount,"No enough shares");

        info.shares[pool]-=amount;
        Action memory action;
        action.epoch = _getNextEpoch();
        action.pool = pool;
        action.withdrawAmount = amount;
        info.actions.push(action);

        PoolEpochData storage data = poolEpochData[action.epoch][action.pool];
        data.withdrawals+=amount;
        emit WithdrawFromPool(msg.sender,amount,pool,action.epoch);
    }

`

    * This function withdraws a specified amount of shares from a given pool. The withdrawal is scheduled for the next epoch. The function checks if the pool is initialized and if the amount is positive. _bookKeeping function is called to update the user's bookkeeping.

    The userInfo mapping is used to ensure that the user has enough shares to withdraw. If the user has enough shares, the specified amount is subtracted from their share balance. An Action struct is created to store the details of the withdrawal and pushed to the user's actions array.

    The poolEpochData mapping is used to update the withdrawal amount for the next epoch in the specified pool. Finally, an WithdrawFromPool event is emitted with the user's address, the amount, the pool, and the epoch in which the withdrawal will occur.

        ##   Withdraw available collateral to the user

  `

        function withdrawCollateral(int256 amount) external  {
        require (amount>=0,"amount needs to be positive");
        _bookKeeping(msg.sender);
        UserInfo storage  info =  userInfo[msg.sender];
        if (amount<=0) amount = info.withdrawableCollateral; // withdraw all

        require (info.withdrawableCollateral>=amount,"Balance to low");
        info.withdrawableCollateral-=amount;

        if (amount>0 && address(collateralToken)!=address(0x0)) require(collateralToken.transfer(msg.sender,uint256(amount)),"Transfer failed");
        }


`

    * The function allows users to withdraw available collateral to their accounts. If amount is not provided, the function withdraws all the withdrawable collateral. The function first calls _bookKeeping to update the user's information. Then it checks if the user's withdrawable collateral is greater than or equal to the requested amount. If yes, it deducts the amount from the user's withdrawable collateral and transfers the same amount to the user's account if amount is greater than zero and the collateralToken address is not equal to address(0x0).

    ## Start a new epoch external call, free to call


`
    
    function startNextEpoch() external  {
        _startNextEpoch();
    }
`

    **  This function starts a new epoch. It is an external function that   can be called by anyone. It simply calls the internal _startNextEpoch() function to start the new epoch.
    
        ##   Withdraw admin fees
`

    function withdrawAdminFees(int256 amount) external {
    require (msg.sender==admin,"Only admin");
    require (amount<=adminFees,"Not enough funds");
    adminFees-=amount;
    if (address(collateralToken)!=address(0x0)) require(collateralToken.transfer(msg.sender,uint256(amount)),"Transfer failed");
    }

`

    *  This function allows the admin to withdraw admin fees. It is an external function that takes an amount parameter indicating how much to withdraw. The function requires that the caller is the admin and that the amount being withdrawn is less than or equal to the current admin fees. If these requirements are met, the admin fees are reduced by the specified amount and the collateral is transferred to the admin's address, if applicable.


       ## Do the bookkeeping for a user (for testing)

`

    function bookKeeping() external {
        _bookKeeping(msg.sender);
    }

`

    *  This function performs bookkeeping for a user. It is an external function that can be called by anyone. It simply calls the internal _bookKeeping() function to perform the bookkeeping for the user who called the function.

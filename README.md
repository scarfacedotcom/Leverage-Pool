## What is Frax?
Frax is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain â€“ currently implemented on Ethereum (with possible cross chain implementations in the future). The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.

* epochStartTime: The timestamp of the start of the current epoch.
* epoch: The current epoch number.
* price: The price of the underlying asset.
* adminFees: The percentage of the admin fees.
* PRECISION: A constant value for precision calculations.
* SECONDS_PER_YEAR: A constant value for the number of seconds in a year.
* TRANSACTION_FEE: The percentage of the transaction fee.

### UserInfo Struct
* index: The index of the user in the users array.
* actions: An array of Action structs representing the user's actions in the leverage pool.
* withdrawableCollateral: The amount of collateral that the user can withdraw.
* shares: A mapping of epoch numbers to the user's shares in the leverage pool.
